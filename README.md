Moon Stone Games is a play 2 earn game ecosystem. It plans to create a big blockchain powered game network to create a huge gameverse.

Highlights

GameWallet - The creation of a single carrier of "inventory" value for each game released. Each item in NFT form would have a real-world use in each game. 

GameChain - Creating a special chain of games that could refer to each other and derive information. This would allow games to be cross gameplay.

Future

Until our technological solutions are developed, we want to build a P2E community and create games that are prepared for future solutions, but also show real possibilities for P2E adoption.
